    ### Insights from Analysis

Based on the provided question papers, the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ exams for the MCA program show a consistent focus on both **theoretical concepts** and **practical application through coding**. [cite\_start]The questions are designed to test a student's understanding of core OOP principles and their ability to implement them correctly in C++[cite: 5, 124, 157, 216]. [cite\_start]A significant portion of the exam is dedicated to writing full programs, ranging from simple function implementations to more complex class-based problems[cite: 23, 29, 34, 42, 54, 76, 78, 82, 110]. [cite\_start]There's a clear emphasis on **memory management** and **pointers**, as seen in multiple questions analyzing code outputs[cite: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50].

### Most Important Topics

  * **Core OOP Concepts**: This is the foundation of the exam. [cite\_start]Questions frequently test the understanding of fundamental principles like constructors, destructors, inheritance, polymorphism, and friend functions[cite: 15, 17, 18, 22, 88, 193, 194, 195].
  * **Inheritance**: Multiple and multilevel inheritance are particularly important. [cite\_start]Questions often require the implementation of inheritance hierarchies and the resolution of potential ambiguities[cite: 29, 32, 88].
  * **Pointers and Arrays**: Pointers are a recurring theme, especially in "what's the output" questions. [cite\_start]Students must be able to trace pointer arithmetic and its effect on arrays[cite: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50].
  * **Operator Overloading**: Overloading operators like `+` and `=` is a frequent coding task. [cite\_start]The exams also test the rules and limitations of operator overloading, particularly with respect to friend functions[cite: 22, 23].
  * **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to text files is a common practical problem. [cite\_start]Questions involve tasks like counting specific characters or processing structured data from a file[cite: 76, 199, 211, 220].
  * [cite\_start]**Recursion**: Recursive functions are a key topic, especially for tasks like finding the maximum element in an array or counting occurrences in a vector[cite: 78, 246, 252, 254]. [cite\_start]The concept of the runtime stack in recursive calls is also tested[cite: 254].

### Predicted Question Patterns

  * **Short Answer (Theoretical)**: Expect 2-3 questions asking for justifications or explanations of specific OOP concepts. [cite\_start]These are typically short and direct, focusing on "why" and "how"[cite: 15, 17, 18, 22].
  * **Code Output Analysis**: A few questions will provide C++ code snippets and ask for the exact output. [cite\_start]These often involve complex pointer operations, loops, or string manipulations[cite: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74].
  * [cite\_start]**Implementation of Class Hierarchies**: A major question will require writing a complete C++ program to design and implement a class structure with inheritance (e.g., a student-test-result hierarchy)[cite: 29].
  * [cite\_start]**Function-based Coding**: Several questions will ask for a C++ function to perform a specific task, such as processing an array, handling a file, or implementing a recursive algorithm[cite: 34, 76, 78, 243, 252].
  * [cite\_start]**Combined Concepts**: A single question might combine multiple concepts, such as using a `map` or `vector` with recursion[cite: 243, 246].

### Practice Questions

#### Easy

1.  **Why is a destructor not allowed to be a virtual function?** Justify your answer. (3 marks)
2.  Write a C++ program that defines a class `Book` with private members `title` (string) and `price` (float). Implement a default constructor to initialize these members and a parameterized constructor to set their values. Also, create a member function `display()` to print the book's details. (5 marks)
3.  **What is the output produced on execution of the following C++ code?** Note: Assume all required header files are included.
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        int x = 10;
        int *p1 = &x;
        int **p2 = &p1;

        cout << *p1 << " " << **p2 << " " << &x << " " << p1 << " " << p2 << endl;

        *p1 = 20;
        cout << *p1 << " " << **p2 << endl;

        **p2 = 30;
        cout << x << " " << *p1 << endl;

        return 0;
    }
    ```

#### Moderate

1.  **Write a C++ program to add two time objects** (time objects contain hours and minutes) by overloading the binary `+` operator using a member function. Ensure that hours and minutes are handled correctly (e.g., 60 minutes becomes 1 hour). (5 marks)
2.  **Explain the concept of method overriding versus method overloading** in C++. Provide a simple C++ code example for each to illustrate the difference. (5 marks)
3.  **Design a C++ class hierarchy for a university system.** Create a base class `Person` with members `name` and `age`. Derive two classes, `Student` and `Faculty`, from `Person`. The `Student` class should have an additional member `rollNo`, and the `Faculty` class should have `employeeId`. Implement a `display()` function in each class to show the relevant details. Also, demonstrate how a function can accept a `Person` object reference and dynamically call the correct `display()` function for either a `Student` or a `Faculty` object using virtual functions. (10 marks)
4.  **Write a C++ function `CountWords(string filename)`** that takes the name of a text file as input, reads its content, and returns the total number of words. A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces or newlines. (5 marks)

#### Hard

1.  **Write a recursive function in C++ to check if a given string is a palindrome.** Do not use any built-in functions to reverse the string or find its length. Your function should accept the string and starting and ending indices as arguments. Also, show the runtime stack for the function call `isPalindrome("racecar")`. (10 marks)
2.  **Write a C++ program to implement a queue using a single-linked list.** The program should include a class `Queue` with member functions for `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `is_empty()`, and `display()`. Your implementation should handle dynamic memory allocation and deallocation appropriately. (15 marks)
3.  **What is the output produced on execution of the following C++ code?**
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;

    class Base {
    public:
        void show() {
            cout << "Base::show()" << endl;
        }
    };

    class Derived1 : public Base {
    public:
        void show() {
            cout << "Derived1::show()" << endl;
        }
    };

    class Derived2 : public Base {
    public:
        void show() {
            cout << "Derived2::show()" << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Base* b;
        Derived1 d1;
        Derived2 d2;

        b = &d1;
        b->show();

        b = &d2;
        b->show();

        Derived1& d1_ref = d1;
        Base& b_ref = d1_ref;
        b_ref.show();

        return 0;
    }
    ```
    Now, modify the `show()` function in the base class to be `virtual` and re-evaluate the output. Justify the difference in the two outputs. (5 marks)
